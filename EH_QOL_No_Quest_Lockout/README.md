# No Quest Lockout

Welcome to the EH-QoL No Quest Lockout mod for 7 Days to Die!

Retry a quest as soon as you like! Sometimes the game crashes and we'd just like to restart the quest as soon as we log back in, but there's a penalty delay enforced of about 1 in-game hour. This removes that limitation! Retry quests again as soon as you like.

This mod contains a simple DLL that uses a Harmony patch to overwrite a single constant in a single function.
