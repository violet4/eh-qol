EH QoL: Eldritch Hollows Quality-of-Life mods

This is a collection of mods for The Fun Pimps' 7 Days to Die!

Contents:
* [No Quest Lockout](https://github.com/violet4/eh-qol/tree/main/EH_QOL_No_Quest_Lockout): When you fail a quest (due to death, disconnection, or leaving the quest radius; which is worse?), there's a 1-hour in-game penalty before you can try the quest again. Wait no more!
